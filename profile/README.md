# Welcome to your village!
Here is a brief history of Arch.
## aqui's start
In a world where anarchy evolves a Minecraft Server with darkness and unfaith, [aquiffoo](https://www.github.com/aquiffoo), on October 14th 2024, decided to build a house close to [face](https://www.github.com/face-hh)'s and there founded an unnamed community whom he would help with free furnaces, coal, donations, and make friends like [PlOszukiwacz](https://www.github.com/ploszukiwaczdev) and [Gizzy](https://www.github.com/gizzyuwu), that helped him in his journey. On the next day (15th), he made huge reforms and called it the Arch Village, consistent of 3 people by the time.

## Darkness begins to arise...
On October 16th, over half of the server is shocked by discovering that imensely impactful genocidal and vandal practices were made by a currently misterious person. And these involved:
- Mass theft of all chests and barrels in the village;
- Pet m#rder (including axolotls and aqui's dog, Zipper);
- Sign trolls;
- Theft of all coal of the community furnaces.

All this made PlOszukiwacz exit the village to move thousands of blocks away, then inviting aqui, the leader of Arch, to also migrate to a provisory government place, that remains a secret to this day.

## GIF-ASS gets founded
On October 16th, aqui, PlOszukiwacz and gizzy join the Group of Intelligence Forces of Arch State Speciality (GIF-ASS), "is the CIA of Arch Village. the government of arch created the organization to investigate and punish ethically the oposition and griefers", in his own words.

## What is this profile for?
Here, aquiffoo, PlOszukiwacz and Gizzy are gonna work on projects related to the server and Arch Village (minecraft plugins, documents, etc.)
